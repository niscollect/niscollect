#### I am a student
I love learning new things, and pondering over solutions to real problems.

I am currently learning Web Development, while trying my hands over DSA.
I like tangible results, and hence I love web development. Still I'm in learning phase. Learning from people, surroundings and failed projects.
I'm currently working on a Website for women safety on roads. 
I have previously developed a platform connecting individual donors to NGOs and other Non-Profit Organizations.
